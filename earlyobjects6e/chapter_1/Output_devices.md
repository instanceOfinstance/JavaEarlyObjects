Out is any data the computer sends to the outside world. It might be a sales report, a list of names, or a graphic image. The data is sent to an output device, which formats and presents it. Common output devices are monitors and printers. Disk drives, USB drives, and CD/DVD recorders can also be considered output devices, because the CPU sends data to them in order to be saved.
