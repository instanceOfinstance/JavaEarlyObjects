Random access memory or RAM is a device that holds data. Specifically RAM holds the sequences of instructions in the programs that are running, and the datat those programs are using.

Memory is divided into sections that hold an equal amount of data. Each section is made of eight "switches" that may be either off or on. A switch in the on position usually represents the number 1, although a switch in the off usually represents the number 0. The computer stores data by setting the switches in a memory location to a pattern that represents a character or a number.

Each of those switches is known as a bit, which stands for a binary digit. Each sectoin of memory, which is a collection of eight bits, is knwon as a byte. Each byte is assigned a unique number known as an address. 

The addresses are ordered from lowest to highest. A byte is identified by its address in much the same way a post office box is identified by an address.

RAM is usually a volatile type of memory, used only for temporary storage. When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are erased.
